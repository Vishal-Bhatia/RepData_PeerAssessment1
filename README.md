This is my submission for the first assigment for the Reproducible Research course.

This repo contains the primary data ("activity.csv"), and the analyses files:
- the PA1_template.Rmd file that outputs the HTML file;
- for assessment, I am also uploading the PA1_template.md file, and the four figure files.

Note that for the analyses to run fine, the following are needed:
- both files are to be saved in the session working directory;
- the "lattice" package has to be downloaded and installed.
